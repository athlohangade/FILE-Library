Use of Linux man pages was most helpful in the project. All information was
neatly described in the man pages. In addition to that, some help was taken from
'C programming language' book by Kernighan and Ritchie. Internet was sometimes
helpful to know some new concepts like stat function which is used to get the
file size. Websites like www.stackoverflow.com are good. The main aim of using
buffer is that the number of times to access the main memory is reduced by using
it. Accessing main memory for reading small number of bytes is heavy operation.
So loading the data from the main memory to the buffer in the form of chunks is
quite helpful and cost low.
